# Computer vision projects
Here are a couple of notebooks that I created for my Computer Vision class.
1) In the first I explored several architectures for a classification problem (8 classes of blood cells). Among them, I implemented from scratch a ViT.
2) In the second I tried building from scratch a Mask R-CNN: after realizing that the RPN was not converging due to a lack of data, I fine-tuned a model from Detectron2. The goal was to identify sensitive objects in office settings and blur them. (THE FOLDER IS MISSING; REMEMBER TO UPLOAD IT)
